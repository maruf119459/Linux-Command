Here's a comprehensive guide to commonly used **`vi`** commands, covering navigation, editing, searching, saving, and more. **`vi`** (and its enhanced version, **`vim`**) is a powerful text editor widely used in Unix-like systems.

---

## **Starting vi**

```bash
vi filename
```

This command opens **`vi`** with the specified file. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, **`vi`** will create it upon saving.

---

## **Modes in vi**

**`vi`** operates in three primary modes:

1. **Normal Mode**: Default mode for navigation and basic commands.
2. **Insert Mode**: Mode to insert or edit text.
3. **Command Mode**: Mode to execute commands (e.g., saving, quitting).

To switch modes:

- **Normal Mode**: Press `Esc` to exit to Normal mode.
- **Insert Mode**: Press `i`, `I`, `a`, `A`, `o`, or `O`.
- **Command Mode**: Press `:` while in Normal mode.
